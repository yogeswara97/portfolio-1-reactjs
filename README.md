# My First Portfolio

Welcome to my first portfolio project! This is a personal website built using **React.js** and **Vite**, showcasing my skills, projects, and journey as a developer.

## Overview

This project serves as a minimal yet modern setup to demonstrate my abilities in front-end development. It leverages the power of React for building dynamic UI components and Vite for a fast and efficient development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

## Features

- Built with **React.js** for a component-based architecture
- Powered by **Vite** for lightning-fast builds and HMR
- Responsive design to ensure a seamless experience across devices
- Clean and maintainable code following ESLint rules

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for a fast dev environment
- **ESLint**: Ensures code quality and consistency
- Optional plugins used:
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) with Babel for Fast Refresh
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) with SWC for Fast Refresh

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-first-portfolio
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite assigns).

## Purpose

This portfolio is my first step into the world of React development. Itâ€™s a space to display my projects, share my learning experience, and connect with others in the tech community.

## Future Improvements

- Add more interactive features and animations
- Integrate a backend for dynamic content
- Enhance accessibility and SEO
